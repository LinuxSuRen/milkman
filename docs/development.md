IDE Setup
===

The project should be easily importable into any IDE, just some pre-requisites:

* [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) plugin has to be installed into ide
* Maven Github Package registry has to be setup in ~/.m2/settings.xml
  * see [manual](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/packages/guides/configuring-apache-maven-for-use-with-github-packages#authenticating-with-a-personal-access-token) for more information
  * only the `<servers>` part is necessary
